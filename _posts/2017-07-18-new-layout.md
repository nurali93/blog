**It's been a long time** since I last make changes to this website and I haven't written a post since then. The main purpose of this website was for me to be very attractive to job recruiter or such as. Then, I managed to land a job and this website left a good impression to my current employer. Basically, the website has served its purpose.

## [HELL YEAH I'M WORKING NOW]({{ site.url }}/working)

The previous layout was too _hambar_ so I decided to make some changes but I came acrossed a [jekyll theme](jekyllthemes.org) called [Moon](github.com/TaylanTatli/Moon) and it was very easy to setup hence the new layout. The following are steps to install this theme:

## Installation
* Fork the [Moon repo](https://github.com/TaylanTatli/Moon/fork)
* Edit `_config.yml` file.
* Remove sample posts from `_posts` folder and add yours.
* Edit `index.md` file in `about` folder.
* Change repo name to `YourUserName.github.io` 

As some said during Dota 2 session **EZ KATKA!!** (if and only if you're winning the game)
