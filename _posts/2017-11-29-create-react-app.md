I was positioned as a Front-end developer and was not required to be specialize in ReactJS as there's 'React Developer' position in this current company. But as time passed by, the current project I involved with required me to obtain that particular skill set.

ReactJS is quite fun actually! Everything seems fast with the single page application concept but to understand it.... I guessed I haven't involve with Javascript for a long time. **It's an important shit!**

React itself is quite easy to understand actually with the props and state stuff  but when it comes to state management, that's a whole new level. Redux.. i cried...

I'm actually getting more interested to learn back end development. RoR is fun and Elixir is interesting. But I'm still gasping on functional programming concept since I know I'm suck at object oriented programming. I need to sharpen more on my logic thinking.

Learning is a life process and i need to learn those stuffs so that i can survive my life to continue learning. \*Insert lifecycle meme\*
