The only time I'll update my blog is when I changed my theme, hence the new layout. I'm not indecisive or something but there's this thing called Google Page Insight and I try hard to score 100 even though the insignificant of it. Even Google's product called Youtube doesn't score 100 but it's still functional. I recapped, 'insignificant'.
