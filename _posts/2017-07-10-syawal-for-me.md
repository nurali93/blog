The day has come where everyone is very happy and pretty in new _baju melayu_ and _baju kurung_ celebrating a once in a year festival. **RAYA OH YEAH**(_in yuna's harmony_). Most of the states in Malaysia celebrate Raya on the 1st of Syawal but in Sarawak, they really hype the celebration for 7 days straight (_seminggu berhari-raya, kunjung mengunjung rumah terbuka OI_). 

Okayy ye laa, some places might also do the same even up to the whole month but what I know is **only in Sarawak**, people celebrate wearing full set of _baju melayu_ with _samping_ and _baju kurung, kebaya, kebarung(apparently it does existed)_ **ALL DAY, ERR DAY** for seven days straight **ATLEAST.** 

This raya it felt different because I feel that I prefered to stay at home rather than _beraya_ the whole day. Raya for me is my internal conflict to go out _beraya_ with whom. The choices are either family or friends, then friends are divided to several groups of friend. This year, I prioritize to _beraya_ with my family as I spent most of my time nowadays away from them so it felt great having them by my side.

All the hapiness comes at a **great cost** for those who didn't really took care of their eating style. Raya food are the best! But the calories the food came with are disaster. You spent a month fasting and on the 1st of Syawal, the weight scale return back to normal. But I really do anticipate my family 1st Raya meals. My personal favourite are _ketupat_ and _Ayam Masak Merah._ But I might missed this meals next year Raya, who knows during that time I'm still alive or celebrating Raya at a different place (_hehe_).

This Raya is also the first time for me to give out _duit raya_, got a lot of extras though so that returned to my wallet(_note to self: change your money to RM5 rather than RM1 in case of extras_). It's fun actually to hand out _duit raya_, not to feel pride that 'I have money now, take some' but it's more to give back what I gain before. Those kids hapiness when receiving _duit raya_, I really do missed that feeling (_although I got a few duit raya this year, I can't do anything since I look like a kid :p_)
